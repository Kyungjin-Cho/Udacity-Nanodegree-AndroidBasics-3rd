# Udacity-Nanodegree-AndroidBasics-3rd
## by Kyungjin Cho
This repository will be used for the '3rd Project: Quiz App.'

## Project Overview
> The Quiz App project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making your own Android app - taking it from the idea stage to building out the full app. You can share your app with family and friends, as well as with other students in this course.  
The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice. We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. Itâ€™s up to you what the quiz questions will be about and how you want to present them to your user. (Per the rubric, we require a minimum of 4 questions and a maximum of 10 quiz questions for a proper app submission).

## Build Your Project
1. First, build the layout. This involves creating the quiz questions, deciding what type of quiz they will be, and formatting them in the xml layout file for your Activity.

2. Second, you'll want to write code that links the layout to the activity. For step 3, you'll want variables that refer to each of the quiz answers.

3. Finally, write the code for the button which checks your answers. This code should run through each question in the app, record whether the user got the question right, and then display the quiz results in a Toast message.

## Requirements
- Planning your app design before coding.
- Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
- Creating, positioning, and styling views.
- Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
- Commenting and documenting your code.
